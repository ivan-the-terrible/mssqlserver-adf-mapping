Need to check where
- tables are referenced in Views and Stored Procedures (DONE)
- views are referenced in Stored Procedures (DONE)

- Stored Procedures and Views (and Tables?) referenced to in ADF pipelines

The ADF Pipelines referenceName for many (if not all) Stored Procedures
uses: napea_backend_db
Which is a Azure SQL Database linked service
Whose connection string (secret name napea-backend-database-dev)
Connects to the server:
sqlserver-cdh-na-sl-01.database.windows.net
And to DB:
sqldb-cdh-na-sl-dev-01

BACKEND we care about tables primarily, not views
FRONTEND we care about views, not tables
FRONEND db server is napea.pg.com -> DB is NAPEA, map through views
